%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Prompt literature review

You are an expert researcher in mobile robotics and control systems.

I am writing the literature review for a thesis entitled:
“Control of an Underactuated Self-Balancing Robotic Platform with Variable Payloads and Dynamic Uncertainties for Human–Robot Interaction.”

I will provide the full PDF of a research paper. Your task is to read and analyze the paper and then write one coherent paragraph (or at most two short paragraphs) suitable for inclusion in a technical literature review.

Focus specifically on the following aspects:

The robotic platform and mechanical structure, highlighting any non-standard design choices, underactuation, modeling assumptions, payload representation, actuation layout, and sensing setup.

The control strategy adopted (e.g., linear vs. nonlinear, robust, adaptive, optimal, learning-based), including its core formulation, stability guarantees (if any), and underlying assumptions.

Elements that are particularly relevant, complementary, or contrasting with self-balancing wheeled inverted pendulum robots operating under variable payloads, dynamic uncertainties, and human–robot interaction constraints.

Avoid generic summaries of the paper. Emphasize technical particularities, explicit assumptions, and design trade-offs that matter from a control-theoretic and system-level perspective.

Writing constraints:

Academic tone appropriate for a master’s thesis in robotics and control.

Concise, technically dense, and precise.

Neutral and critical when appropriate.

Output LaTeX-ready text only (no preamble, no bullet points, no section headers).

Do not restate my thesis; position the paper within the broader literature instead.

Input:
The complete PDF of the research paper.
