\begin{abstract}
This paper presents an adaptive control framework for self-balancing wheeled robots that simultaneously handles variable payloads and external disturbances during human-robot collaboration. The approach integrates Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) with disturbance observers to achieve real-time adaptation without dedicated payload sensors. A Disturbance Observer (DOB) estimates external forces while Reaction Disturbance Observers (RDOB) infer payload mass and center-of-gravity from actuator reaction forces. These estimates continuously update the NMPC internal model, enabling seamless adaptation during manipulation tasks. A prediction error-based collision detection mechanism and supervisory Finite State Machine enhance safety during physical interaction. Simulation results with payloads up to 10~kg demonstrate stable balancing, accurate tracking, effective disturbance rejection, and real-time computational feasibility. The framework advances self-balancing robot control by unifying predictive control with observer-based adaptation for variable payload scenarios.
