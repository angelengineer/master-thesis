This paper presented an adaptive control framework for self-balancing wheeled robots with variable payloads. By integrating Nonlinear Model Predictive Control with Disturbance and Reaction Disturbance Observers, the approach achieves continuous adaptation to payload changes without physical sensors. Real-time estimation of payload mass and center-of-gravity enables online updating of the NMPC internal model, maintaining stable balancing and accurate tracking under dynamic uncertainties. The prediction error-based collision detection mechanism provides reliable interaction awareness compatible with varying payloads. Simulation results validate the framework under combined payload changes, motion commands, and external collisions, demonstrating stable operation and real-time computational feasibility.

Future work includes experimental validation on the physical platform, extension to 3D motion and terrain variations, and integration with autonomous navigation capabilities for human-robot collaborative logistics applications.
