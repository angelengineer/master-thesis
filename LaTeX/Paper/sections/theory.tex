\subsection{Heading A}

This section describes the theoretical background of the proposed approach.

\begin{equation}
\alpha + \beta = \gamma
\label{eq:example}
\end{equation}

All symbols in~\eqref{eq:example} are defined before or immediately after the equation.

\subsection{Heading B}

Additional theoretical considerations are discussed here.
